## Analyzing User Spending Behavior

This project explores and analyzes user spending patterns, credit usage, and financial behavior using multiple data sources:

- **PostgreSQL tables:** User, Account  
- **Parquet/Arrow files:** transactions_parquet, transactions_arrow  
- **MongoDB:** cards  

The analysis focuses on understanding user financial habits, assessing risk, and identifying trends in spending and credit usage.

---

### 1. User Spending & Transactions
- Summarizes individual user spending, transaction volume, and number of credit cards.
- Helps identify high-value customers and analyze spending patterns across different credit scores.

### 2. Credit Utilization Overview
- Compares average credit limits to average spending per user, segmented by number of cards held.
- Useful for detecting credit usage trends, assessing financial risk, and visualizing customer behavior.

### 3. Debt Loading vs. Annual Spending
- Aggregates spending by user income brackets and total debt.
- Enables targeted marketing, debt vs. income analysis, and customer segmentation.

### 4. Credit Utilization Funnel
- Tracks the number of users across key milestones:
  - All users
  - Users with multiple cards
  - High spenders
  - Low credit score
  - Users with compromised cards
- Supports conversion analysis, risk assessment, and targeted interventions.

### 5. High-Risk Financial profiles
- Identifies users with low credit scores and high debt to pinpoint potential financial risks.
- Can be leveraged for credit monitoring, fraud prevention, and strategic financial planning.

## Geographical Analysis of User Data

This section focuses on understanding user behavior and financial metrics in a geographical context. By mapping transactions and financial attributes to user locations, we can gain insights into regional trends, hotspots, and disparities.

---


### 1. Transaction Density by Location (Hot-Spots)
- Measures the total number of transactions per latitude and longitude.
- Useful for identifying regions with high or low financial activity.
- Can support location-based services, regional marketing, or resource allocation.

### 2. Regional Financial Overview
- Aggregates average total debt and yearly income by region.
- Helps compare financial health across different areas.
- Enables detection of high-debt regions or areas with strong income potential.
- Supports strategic planning for credit offers, regional campaigns, and risk assessment.

---

## Potential Use Cases

- **Regional Customer Segmentation:** Group users by location to tailor offers or services.  
- **Hotspot Detection:** Identify areas with high transaction volume or significant financial activity.  
- **Regional Risk Assessment:** Detect regions with higher average debt or financial stress.  
- **Market Planning:** Align marketing, credit, or operational strategies based on regional trends.
