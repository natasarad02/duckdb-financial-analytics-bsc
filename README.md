## Analyzing User Spending Behavior

This project explores and analyzes user spending patterns, credit usage, and financial behavior using multiple data sources:

- **PostgreSQL tables:** User, Account  
- **Parquet/Arrow files:** transactions_parquet, transactions_arrow  
- **MongoDB:** cards  

The analysis focuses on understanding user financial habits, assessing risk, and identifying trends in spending and credit usage.

### 1. User Spending & Transactions
- Summarizes individual user spending, transaction volume, and number of credit cards.
- Helps identify high-value customers and analyze spending patterns across different credit scores.

### 2. Credit Utilization Overview
- Compares average credit limits to average spending per user, segmented by number of cards held.
- Useful for detecting credit usage trends, assessing financial risk, and visualizing customer behavior.

### 3. Debt Loading vs. Annual Spending
- Aggregates spending by user income brackets and total debt.
- Enables targeted marketing, debt vs. income analysis, and customer segmentation.

### 4. Credit Utilization Funnel
- Tracks the number of users across key milestones:
  - All users
  - Users with multiple cards
  - High spenders
  - Low credit score
  - Users with compromised cards
- Supports conversion analysis, risk assessment, and targeted interventions.

### 5. High-Risk Financial profiles
- Identifies users with low credit scores and high debt to pinpoint potential financial risks.
- Can be leveraged for credit monitoring, fraud prevention, and strategic financial planning.
